= portie

portie is a simple wrapper around https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[fzf] which allows you
to search ports, show port information, and show content of port files.

== Demo

== Requirements

- fzf
+
Install fzf package/link:https://www.freshports.org/textproc/fzf/[port] or place the
`fzf` executable somewhere on your `PATH`.

== Installation

- Download the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ALPHA-60/portie/master/portie[script] and make it executable with `chmod a+x portie`.

== Usage

After running `portie`, you can search for ports by their
origin (e.g. `textproc/fzf`) and short description.

NOTE: Portie will honor the `PAGER` environment variable. If you use `less`,
its `-c` option for clearing the screen from top to bottom will give you
better experience: `PAGER='less -c' portie`


=== Keyboard shortcuts

|===
| Shortcut |Function

|`Tab`   | Toggle window showing additional port info

|`Alt+m` | Show port's `Makefile`

|`Alt+p` | Show port's `pkg-plist` file

|`Alt+d` | Show port's `distinfo` file

|`Alt+b` | Run `make build-depends-list` to show port's build dependencies

|`Alt+c` | Run `make showconfig` to show port's configuration
|===


=== Command line arguments

All arguments will be passed to fzf:

 portie --color=hl+:1 --bind=alt-i:"execute(doas synth install {1})"

You can use this for running custom commands. The numbers (such as "\{1}") denote:

- \{1} - "origin", e.g. `textproc/fzf`
- \{2} - `pkg-descr` file location
- \{3} - maintainer
- \{4} - project's web address
- \{5} - package name, e.g. `fzf-0.18.0`
- \{6} - port directory
- \{7} - short description

=== Troubleshooting

If the list of ports is empty when you run portie, you might be missing the
port INDEX file. Go to your ports directory (`/usr/ports`) and run `make
fetchindex` or `make index`.
